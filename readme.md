# Advent of Code 2023: My Journey

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 journey! This repository documents my solutions and learning experience through this engaging coding challenge.

## About Advent of Code 2023

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve daily coding puzzles throughout December until Christmas. Each puzzle offers a unique problem, accessible to various skill levels and solvable in any programming language. It's a fantastic platform for sharpening coding skills, preparing for interviews, and indulging in some friendly competition.

## My Goals

- **Skill Improvement:** Enhance my problem-solving and coding abilities.
- **Language Proficiency:** Experiment with different programming language i.e. finally tackle in learning Rust.
- **Community Engagement:** Collaborate and exchange ideas with other coders.

## Approach and Methodology

- **Problem-Solving:** Tackle each challenge methodically, starting with understanding the problem, devising a strategy, and then coding the solution.
- **Learning:** Emphasize learning and understanding over just finding the solution.
- **Code Quality:** Focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## Reflections

- **Day [1]:** Having to deal with decisions made on the first part of the test was a challenge. My approach didn't use regex on the first part so the second part took a little bit more involvement to finish.
- **Day [2]:** Creating the parser for this day was super fun. OOP is my passion. Had a lot of fun on this one.
- **Day [3]:** Another day that I am using OOP to solve the problem. I hated having coding the first part focusing on the number instead of the symbol. I had to literally refactor the code to be symbol-centric lol.
